  <h2>Intro to Robotics</h2>
    <p> I learned that using our personal experiences, we can desgin robots that can be beneficial to different groups of people as we understand the needs of that specific group.
        As we share similar problems with other people around the world, our personal challenges become inspirations for us to construct robots that will make daily activities easier to complete for everyone.
        The robots that we build carry the purpose of serving the community.
        The current advancement in the field of robotics such as self-driven cars make me excited becuase incorporting robots into our everyday lives is no longer just a dream. Instead, it is slowly becoming a reality.

        Working in groups to build circuits was helpful as all group members were helping another with certain challenges that we have had.
        Although we had been helping one another, we could have communicated more.
        Even when we do not have questions, we could have brainstormed ideas together and gain inspirations from one another.
