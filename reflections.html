  <h2>Intro to Robotics</h2>
    <p> I learned that using our personal experiences, we can desgin robots that can be beneficial to different groups of people as we understand the needs of that specific group.
        As we share similar problems with other people around the world, our personal challenges become inspirations for us to construct robots that will make daily activities easier to complete for everyone.
        The robots that we build carry the purpose of serving the community.
        The current advancement in the field of robotics such as self-driven cars make me excited becuase incorporting robots into our everyday lives is no longer just a dream. Instead, it is slowly becoming a reality.
     </br>
        Working in groups to build circuits was helpful as all group members were helping another with certain challenges that we have had.
        Although we had been helping one another, we could have communicated more.
        Even when we do not have questions, we could have brainstormed ideas together and gain inspirations from one another.

  <h2>Intro to Robotics - Blinking LED's</h2>
    <p> My partner, Sita, and I worked together on the lightshow by discussing how we vision our lightshow to be.
        We helped each other with debugging our codes.
        Although we were working together to create the same lightshow, we would sometimes work at different pace.
        As a result, we would sometimes have different codes.
     </br>
     </br> The basic pieces of every Arduino sketch:
     </br> #include <Servo.h> which imports the servo library
     </br> Servo servoLeft; and Servo servoRight; which declares the left and right wheel of the robot
     </br> void setup() {} where you define your input
    </p>
  </br>

  <h2>Intro to Robotics - Dance Party</h2>
    <p> I learned that the vertical rows (the shorter rows with 5 holes) are connected.
        I also learned that a piezo can create alternating current.
     </br>
        My favorite part of my robot's dance is when it turns 360 degrees because it follows the rhythm of the song that my partner and I selected.
    </p>

  <h2>Intro to Robotics - Escape Bot</h2>
    <p> Today I learned how navigate an Arduino with whiskers.
        I also learned how to control the sound that the robot makes as well as how to incoporate while loops into my Arduino code.
        My group worked very well together as we had fun while helping each other with our Arduino codes.

   <h2>Django</h2>
    <p>Model-View-Controller Paradigm is a pattern that relates user interface to data models in three categories: model, view, controller.
       The model is the interface to data, allowing you to pull data from the database.
       The view is the interface to collect user input as well as what you see.
       The controller controls the flow of information between the model and the view.
       We use web framework instead of creating an app ourselves because it makes it easior to develop web applications.
       A web framwork is different from a library as it is a collection of what you use in your app while a library is a collection of all the functions.

   <h2>Django Day 2</h2>
    <p>After working through the Django tutorial for two days, I am currently learning about Django ORM and QuerySets.
     I would like to be at the stage of customizing my blog because that is when I can use my creativity to create what I want to see on the web page.
     With the same structure that I used in my portfolio page, I can also create other informational websites.
     I would like more practice using javascript to make my web page more interactive.
     Working through the Django tutorial, I am still confused on specific lines of code that I was shown to run into the consel.
     The code works when I run it and I somewhat understand the purpose of the code, but I do not understand the syntax of the code.
